# UI Luxury & Layout Adjustments Walkthrough

## Summary
The UI has been significantly refined to feel more "premium" and functional on mobile devices. Additionally, the project has been initialized as a Git repository and all changes have been committed.

## Key Changes
### 1. Luxury Compact Design
- Reduced overall font sizes and tightened spacing to avoid the "cluttered" feel.
- Enhanced card styles with softer borders and glassmorphism-inspired effects.

### 2. Collapsible Sections
- Added accordion functionality to the `ScoreInputPage`. Users can now collapse sections they don't need, making the interface cleaner.

### 3. Smart Note Input
- The notes section now starts at a reasonable height and expands automatically as the user types more content.

### 4. Color Synchronization
- Section colors in the input page now perfectly match the Daily Class detail page, providing better visual context.

### 5. Git repository initialization
- Initialized a new Git repository.
- Successfully committed all project files with a "feat" commit message.

## Results
- No more horizontal overflow on small screens.
- Improved readability and focus.
- Better user experience for logging non-scorable sections (notes only).
- Project history is now tracked via Git.
